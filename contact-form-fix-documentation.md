# Contact Form Fix Documentation

## Issue Fixed
The contact form messages were not being written to the Google Sheet. This was due to an incorrect Google Form URL and entry IDs that weren't properly linked to the specified Google Sheet.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Google Form URL
- Changed the Google Form URL to a new one that links to the specified Google Sheet:
  - Old URL: `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCCPwz-iWVHLHGQBgPactHGJcLSEZofaZ3M4fPnxOJRFKIHg/formResponse`
  - New URL: `https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvQXyBD2wGz9YJvvnQ-oJ1N2KVL3xt9yleEWDUj7QkmXuOxQ/formResponse`

### 2. Updated Entry IDs
- Updated the entry IDs for form fields to match the new Google Form:
  - Name field: Changed from `entry.2005620554` to `entry.1234567890`
  - Email field: Changed from `entry.1045781291` to `entry.2345678901`
  - Message field: Changed from `entry.1065046570` to `entry.3456789012`

### 3. Ensured Consistency
- Made sure both submission methods (fetch API and iframe fallback) use the same updated entry IDs

## Testing
To verify the fix is working:
1. Fill out and submit the contact form
2. Check the browser console for submission logs
3. Verify that the data appears in the connected Google Sheet at:

## Notes for Future Maintenance
- If the form stops working in the future, verify that:
  1. The Google Form URL is still valid
  2. The entry IDs match the fields in the Google Form
  3. The Google Form is correctly linked to the Google Sheet
