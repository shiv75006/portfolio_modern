# Contact Form Fix Summary

## Issue
The contact form in the portfolio website needed to be connected to a Google Apps Script that writes form submissions to a Google Sheet.

## Solution
1. Updated the Google Apps Script URL in the contact form to use the provided deployment URL.
2. Modified the data format from FormData to JSON to match the requirements of the Google Apps Script.
3. Updated both the primary (fetch API) and fallback (iframe) submission methods to handle JSON data correctly.

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/Footer.jsx`: Updated the form submission logic to use the correct URL and data format.

## Testing
The contact form can be tested by:
1. Filling out the form with valid data
2. Submitting the form
3. Verifying that the data appears in the connected Google Sheet
