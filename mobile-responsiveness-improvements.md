## Testing

A comprehensive test plan has been created to verify the mobile responsiveness of the website. The test plan includes:

1. Testing on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
2. Specific test cases for each component
3. General responsive design guidelines
4. Tools and methods for testing

## Future Recommendations

1. **Performance Optimization**: Consider lazy loading images and optimizing assets for mobile
2. **Touch Interactions**: Enhance touch interactions for mobile users
3. **Progressive Web App**: Consider implementing PWA features for better mobile experience
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure all interactive elements meet accessibility standards for mobile
5. **Regular Testing**: Continuously test on new devices and browsers
